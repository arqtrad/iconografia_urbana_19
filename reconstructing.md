Reconstructing Brazilianness
============================

In 1914, Severo gave a highly influential lecture at the Artistic
Culture Society in São Paulo, titled *Traditional Art in Brazil: The
House and the Temple*. He shared in Gonzaga Duque's late view that
local culture had not yet developed sufficient strength to establish a
national artistic character. Unlike the art critic, however, Severo
would not wait patiently for a national school to gradually emerge out
of the cumulative efforts of individual artists: he outlined, instead,
what would give Brazilian architecture a distinctive character right
away. Severo argued that the forms and plans implanted in the Americas
by the Portuguese colonists, chiefly derived from both Roman and
Moorish sources, were to be the basis for the establishment of a
national-traditional art in Brazil [@azevedo:1994ideas, p. 249] He
followed up this first conference with further texts, putting forward
his ideas about a new traditional Brazilian architecture. In a 1917
article in one of the country's most important magazines of the time,
Severo emphasized the adaptation of Portuguese styles in Brazil as the
source of a local authenticity:

> The Portuguese always gave a particular mark to the architecture he
> imported, and this phenomenon, noted by the most illustrious
> historians of Portuguese art, shows up in colonial Brazil as well,
> where the Baroque, said to be Jesuit, took on expressions of modest
> simplicity, but with a noteworthy local mark [@severo:1917arte, p.
> 402]

He made a point to show how churches and houses in the colonial period
displayed that sort of plainness, "being appropriated into the local
setting and in their aspect of characteristic originality" were to
constitute "what is or may come to be Traditional Architecture" in
Brazil. Severo went on to describe how the vigor of this traditional
architecture persisted in Brazil up to the time of Independence
(1822). At first, he claimed, not even French influence---once decried
by the young Gonzaga Duque---was able to stifle its vitality.
According to the Portuguese engineer, it was only around the second
half of the nineteenth century, and more strongly after the
proclamation of the Republic (1889), that this traditional setting
began to erode. Severo thus proceeded to decry the arrival of fresh
immigrants at that time, "deft stuccoists come from Italy and
Portugal" who brought eclecticism, a façadist habit of making up
"incomprehensible styles that shocked mostly by their disconnection
with the local setting and its destiny" [@severo:1917arte, p. 415] The
solution, he asserted, was to reclaim an authentic national tradition,
consisting in the adaptation of old Portuguese styles, as adapted and
transformed by the influence of local climate and geography.

The argument constructed by Severo thus rested on the ideal of a
national character consisting in a timeless, natural Portuguese
adaptation to their colonial *genius loci*, only to be suppressed by
an unfortunate onset of eclectic influence in the second half of the
nineteenth century. The same cycle of timeless authenticity followed
by a historical gap fostering decadence would be represented, two
years later, in Monteiro Lobato's "dead cities".
Although the fiction writer had a much more explicitly negative view
of the backwardness of the countryside, the Portuguese engineer was
also careful not to romanticize old houses. He made clear his case for
material and even aesthetic progress, if only tempered by traditional
adaptation to the site:

> Traditional Architecture does not mean, then, literal reproduction
> of traditional things, of archaeological fossils, of rammed earth or
> cob houses, of little adobe churches, of back streets between shacks
> three fathoms deep, with door and louvered window, or of the gloomy
> houses in the city centers of yore, without hygiene or aesthetic
> appeal 
>
> Traditional art is the stylization of earlier artistic forms that
> constitute at some point in time the local environment, the moral
> character of a people, the hallmark of its civilization;
> it is the product of a rhythmic evolution of successive cycles of
> art and style .\ .\ .\ . [@severo:1917arte, p. 423--424]

Severo wrote, spoke, and designed in São Paulo, a city that woke up
from its own gloomy slumber of economic inertia as late as the 1860s,
when the construction of the railway turned the city into a major
economic hub. From a point of view taken in São Paulo, little of any
architectural significance had been built in the city between the
reconstruction of the emblematic Jesuit College in 1700, and the
opening of the railways in 1867--1871 [@lemos:1987ecletismo, p. 72]
Neoclassicism in São Paulo had been an essentially rural phenomenon in
those formerly affluent coffee-growing regions, mitigated by the
practical conservatism of local builders. As Monteiro Lobato showed in
his prose, the more traditional of these regions were decadent by the
early twentieth century.
In this context, the Portuguese engineer embraced the neoclassicism of
the first two thirds or so of the nineteenth century as a continuation
of the authentic Portuguese-Brazilian tradition.

Rio de Janeiro, in contrast, was in the 1910s the nation's capital,
twice as large a city as São Paulo, and had a much more diverse
architectural heritage. It had undergone a continuous process of urban
infill and extension throughout the nineteenth century, with a
self-conscious interest in up-to-date architecture, crowned by
large-scale urban renewal in its core starting in 1902. The
differences between traditionalist discourse in São Paulo and Rio are,
thus, probably not surprising. In the capital, this traditionalist
movement was advocated, chiefly among all its proponents, by José
Mariano Filho (1881--1946), a hygienist physician and amateur
architect. He was, incidentally, responsible for coining the word
"Neocolonial" to designate that movement [@kessel:2008arquitetura, p. 132]
Mariano was also instrumental in rousing public support for monumental
buildings to be designed in the neocolonial style, in addition to
having sponsored, with his personal wealth, a number of architectural
competitions biased towards the same style.

In spite of the lifelong ideological constancy of his prolific
writing, José Mariano Filho was perhaps most remembered for having
provided, in 1924, traveling scholarships for a number of young
architects to document what were then the largest surviving ensembles
of colonial Brazilian architecture: the former gold-mining towns of
nearby Minas Gerais State. Among these young architects was Lucio
Costa (1902--1998), future modernist agitator, theorist, and
practitioner, known worldwide for having designed Brasilia, but who
was at that time an enthusiastic supporter of the neocolonial
movement. What Costa took out of this experience will be discussed
later; what interests us for now is how the geographic scope of the
effort was evidence of how differently traditional Brazilian
architecture was perceived in Rio as compared to São Paulo.
