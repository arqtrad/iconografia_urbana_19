Modernity and Preservation
==========================

Mariano's national tradition, even more so than that of Monteiro Lobato and Ricardo Severo, hinged on the notion of ethnicity.
For him, "the preference of man for the architecture of his homeland" had an emotional source, based on domestic reminiscence and unconscious references.
He therefore deplored the Portuguese immigrants and the Brazilians who, "instead of proceeding like the Italians, British, or Germans, who favor the styles of their own nations, .\ .\ .\ . seek intently to hide or mask their own" [@marianno:1943aa, p. 32]
This hiding of the national style, in 1943, could be applied both to eclecticism and to the characterless and "stateless styles" of modern architecture.
Mariano bemoaned the modern mentality, which in abolishing the principle of decor, reduced "the art of building to the science of making housing", requiring merely efficiency and economy [@marianno:1943aa, p. 15]

Art, however, did not mean mere decoration to him.
Whereas Severo in São Paulo gave in to the contemporary taste for modern plans and massing [@mello:2007aa, p. 178], and commissioned painter José Wasth Rodrigues a comprehensive study made almost entirely of details, Mariano steadfastly insisted, as late as 1931, that there was something more fundamental:

> I do not care for the plastic qualities of traditional Brazilian architecture, because what I seek in it is far above these qualities.
  .\ .\ .\ . Less of an artist than a sociologist myself, I consider architecture to be the social instrument of nationality.
  I do not care for artistic virtues, the charm of lines, or the splendor of details, by means of which the architectural styles are expressed.
  What I seek are the organic qualities, the healthy virtues, the structural fundamentals, from which stem the perfect accord of architectural feeling with the nation's soul [@marianno:1943aa, p. 64]

Modern materials and technologies, however, needed not be shunned in this endeavor to forge a new Brazilian architecture that was to remain firmly grounded in deeper principles, respecting its ancestral "Roman spirit, characterized by the constant proportion of its compositional elements, and by its rectangular geometric projection" [@marianno:1943aa, p. 124]
This ideal of material progress rooted in social conservatism echoed in the writings of the young Lucio Costa, his former protégé, who by the 1930s had grown to be Mariano's ideological rival.
In 1929, while still a promoter of traditional architecture, he argued against the example of the exceptional monumental buildings of Brazilian rococo.
An art made in Brazil by individual genius with no apparent following could not form the basis for national character, he believed.
Following his former patron, Costa held that it was, instead, in the simple architecture of anonymous master builders that resided the functional, technical and aesthetic homogeneity of Brazilian character [@puppi:1998aa, p. 22]
After Lucio Costa's conversion to modernism, he authored in 1937 an article describing what he held to be the natural development of traditional Brazilian architecture.
True to his roots, he was speaking of residential architecture built by masons and carpenters, which remained impervious to:

> . . . . The unforeseen development of bad architecture teaching---giving future architects a whole, confused "technical-decorative" education, with no link whatsoever with life, and not explaining them the *why* of each element, nor the deep reasons that conditioned, in each period, the appearance of common features, that is, of a style .\ .\ .\ . [@costa:2007aa, p. 93]

Because Costa did not focus his narrative on learned architecture, he was able to circumvent the problem of "bad teaching", and to argue for the occurrence of an authentic traditional architecture as far forward as 1910.
He could thereby synchronize the decay precisely with the onset of the traditional architecture movement to which he had previously belonged, and which he now condemned.
This opposition notwithstanding, all elements of the post-romantic nationalist narrative were represented in his text:
an original period of authentic national character, followed by another of pretentious or sophisticated decay;
the possibility of overcoming that decay by promoting a certain architectural movement;
the defense of technical modernization and aesthetic advance while remaining anchored in that authentic national tradition.

A few years later, though, Lucio Costa drifted from the broad sociological picture of national character to a romantic view favoring individual artistic intent [@costa:2007ab, p. 113] and personal genius [@costa:2007ac, p. 125], both embodied in his contemporary Oscar Niemeyer.
In this, he was probably influenced by his acquaintance and driving force behind the creation of the National Heritage Service (`SPHAN`), modernist poet Mário de Andrade.

Although Costa put forward the thesis of a chain of authentic architecture broken only by the neocolonial movement, his practice as official of the `SPHAN` effectively upheld Mariano's view that proper traditional Brazilian architecture did not reach far beyond 1800.
In theory, this view should have fostered the protection of colonial-era monuments and urban sites, while denying protection for nineteenth-century structures.
In practice, however, matters were a lot trickier, and actual knowledge of colonial architecture was sparse [@pinheiro:2012aa, p. 25]
On the one hand, the continuation of colonial building practices well into the nineteenth century, and their intermingling with neoclassical influences, had been known to Ricardo Severo and his São Paulo colleagues.
On the other hand, documentation for most sites of historic interest was virtually nonexistent;
dating often relied on conventional wisdom about local history as well as on *a priori* assumptions regarding pre-nineteenth-century styles.
Proof of this uncertainty was that typological studies of colonial buildings, published in the `SPHAN` journal in the 1930s and 40s, one among which penned by Lucio Costa himself, were unable to ascribe even so little as rough date ranges to building types.

This entailed dramatic consequences even for those buildings meant to be preserved. A number of supposed eclectic or neocolonial accretions to historic churches were carelessly replaced with modern recreations of that original "simplicity" heralded by the Rio neocolonial architects themselves [@pinheiro:2012aa, p. 238]
Certain nineteenth-century additions to Ouro Preto houses, such as parapets, were removed because roof overhangs were supposed to be a mainstay of colonial architecture;
forged iron railings, on the other hand, were mistakenly attributed to the eighteenth century and thus incorporated into a canonical image of colonial two-story houses.
In São Paulo, campaniles were "simplified" and entire wings in farmhouses were removed, in an infatuation with the ideal of volumetric simplicity promoted by Mariano and Costa, and followed with zeal by Luís Saia [@mayumi:2008aa, p. 61]
The preservation of elements that seemed to prefigure modern architecture was particularly favored:

> Colonial constructive devices, such as buildings on stilts, trellised louvers, and cob on wooden frames, were associated with *pilotis*, *brise-soleils*, and reinforced concrete.
  For modernist architects, the resemblance between their own architecture and the colonial one was not one of appearance or effect, as was the case in neocolonial buildings, but one of structure [@fonseca:2005aa, p. 188]

Conversely, whatever departed from association with these elements fell easily in place with a picture of eclectic architecture, especially in its popular French-inspired styles: orthostates, articulated wall surfaces, high pitched roofs and so on.
