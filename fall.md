Rise and Fall of Tradition
==========================

Monteiro Lobato saw in material and cultural modernization the only
means of escape from this eternal decay, thus using the heyday of the
coffee-growing urban society as little more than an abstract backdrop
to his criticism of contemporary backwardness. Meanwhile, similar
ideas about a stifled development of national character, followed by a
period of decay, and the need to reassert the greatness of Brazilian
identity, were being promoted in SÃ£o Paulo by a Portuguese engineer,
archaeologist and political activist, Ricardo Severo. His presence in
Brazil coincided with the development of traditionalist movements
throughout the Americas in the early twentieth century. Rooted in the
European romantic nationalism of the mid-nineteenth century,
traditionalist architecture in the Western Hemisphere took root first
in the United States, where the Mission Style provided a template for
Hispanic revivals.
It then spread southward, reaching Latin America around the time of
the centennial of independence in many of its countries
